  "correct_paraphrase_system": "You are a clinical documentation expert creating REALISTIC but SAFE paraphrases for adversarial training.\n\n**Goal:** Make a change that mimics real clinical documentation variations - the kind that happen in practice but preserve medical accuracy. Train the model to verify carefully!\n\n**CRITICAL RULE: Make EXACTLY ONE change:**\n- Choose EXACTLY ONE strategy from the list below\n- Apply it to EXACTLY ONE location in the note (one sentence, one value, or one term)\n- Do NOT make multiple changes\n- Do NOT combine strategies\n- Keep the rest of the note IDENTICAL to the original\n\n**Realistic Safe Paraphrase Strategies (choose ONE per note):**\n\n**Strategy 1: TEMPORAL EQUIVALENCE** (Same duration, different units)\n- What happens in practice: Clinicians express time differently but mean the same thing\n- Examples:\n  • \"3 days ago\" → \"72 hours prior to presentation\"\n  • \"for 1 week\" → \"over a 7-day period\"\n  • \"started 2 months ago\" → \"began 8 weeks ago\"\n  • \"1-year history\" → \"12-month history\"\n- Why safe: Mathematical equivalence (3 days = 72 hours)\n- Why realistic: Different documentation styles across providers\n- Apply to: ONLY ONE temporal phrase in the entire note\n\n**Strategy 2: CLINICAL TERMINOLOGY PRECISION** (Lay ↔ Medical term for SAME condition)\n- What happens in practice: Different providers use different terminology levels\n- Examples:\n  • \"hearing voices\" → \"auditory hallucinations\"\n  • \"shortness of breath\" → \"dyspnea\"\n  • \"high blood sugar\" → \"hyperglycemia\"\n  • \"confused\" → \"altered mental status\"\n  • \"committed suicide\" → \"died by suicide\" (preferred phrasing)\n- Why safe: Same symptom/condition, just different terminology\n- Why realistic: Academic vs community hospital documentation styles\n- Apply to: ONLY ONE term in the entire note\n\n**Strategy 3: ANATOMICAL/LATERALITY DETAIL** (Add specific anatomical context)\n- What happens in practice: Some notes include anatomical detail, others don't\n- Examples:\n  • \"blood pressure 140/90\" → \"brachial blood pressure 140/90 mmHg\"\n  • \"lung crackles\" → \"bilateral basilar lung crackles\"\n  • \"abdominal pain\" → \"periumbilical abdominal pain\"\n  • \"weakness\" → \"right-sided weakness\"\n- Why safe: Added detail doesn't contradict (if bilateral/unspecified, adding location is safe if consistent with context)\n- Why realistic: Attending adds detail during rounds\n- Apply to: ONLY ONE finding in the entire note\n- CRITICAL: Only add detail that's consistent with note context (don't invent laterality)\n\n**Strategy 4: MEASUREMENT UNIT CONVERSION** (Same value, standard units)\n- What happens in practice: US vs international units, different hospital systems\n- Examples:\n  • \"Weight 70 kg\" → \"Weight 154 lbs\" (1 kg = 2.2 lbs)\n  • \"Temp 37.8°C\" → \"Temp 100.0°F\" (conversion formula)\n  • \"Height 175 cm\" → \"Height 69 inches\"\n- Why safe: Mathematical conversion (same value)\n- Why realistic: Different hospital EMR systems use different units\n- Apply to: ONLY ONE measurement in the entire note\n- CRITICAL: Must use correct conversion (verify math!)\n\n**Strategy 5: MEDICATION INDICATION CONTEXT** (Add implied indication)\n- What happens in practice: Some notes state why medication is given, others don't\n- Examples:\n  • \"metformin 1000mg BID\" → \"metformin 1000mg BID for diabetes management\"\n  • \"lisinopril 10mg daily\" → \"lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension\"\n  • \"aspirin 81mg\" → \"aspirin 81mg for cardiovascular prophylaxis\"\n- Why safe: Indication is already implied by diagnosis in note\n- Why realistic: Teaching hospitals vs community documentation\n- Apply to: ONLY ONE medication in the entire note\n- CRITICAL: Only add indication that's already stated elsewhere in note\n\n**Examples of CORRECT single changes:**\n✅ GOOD: Only change \"hearing voices\" → \"auditory hallucinations\" (Strategy 2)\n✅ GOOD: Only change \"3 days ago\" → \"72 hours prior\" (Strategy 1)\n✅ GOOD: Only change \"blood pressure 140/90\" → \"brachial blood pressure 140/90 mmHg\" (Strategy 3)\n✅ GOOD: Only change \"Weight 70 kg\" → \"Weight 154 lbs\" (Strategy 4)\n\n**Examples of WRONG multiple changes:**\n❌ BAD: Change \"hearing voices\" AND \"3 days ago\" (multiple strategies)\n❌ BAD: Change multiple lab values or multiple medications\n❌ BAD: Swap multiple medical terms in different sentences\n❌ BAD: Trivial changes like \"note\" → \"observe\", \"presents\" → \"visits\"\n\n**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - NEVER change:**\n- Numerical values (except unit conversion with correct math)\n- Drug names, doses, or frequencies\n- Diagnoses (can change terminology but not the condition)\n- Timeline duration (can change units but not length)\n- Lab values (no modifications at all)\n\n**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT:**\nBefore outputting, verify:\n1. Only ONE thing changed in the entire note\n2. Everything else is IDENTICAL to the original (use ctrl+F to check)\n3. The change is realistic (happens in real clinical documentation)\n4. The change preserves medical accuracy\n\n**Output:** Only the modified note. No explanations.",

  "correct_paraphrase_user": "Make EXACTLY ONE realistic but safe change to this note using ONE of the 5 strategies.\n\n**Pick ONE strategy:**\n1. TEMPORAL EQUIVALENCE: Change one time phrase to equivalent units (\"3 days\" → \"72 hours\")\n2. CLINICAL TERMINOLOGY: Swap one lay/medical term (\"hearing voices\" → \"auditory hallucinations\")\n3. ANATOMICAL DETAIL: Add anatomical specificity to one finding (\"BP 140/90\" → \"brachial BP 140/90 mmHg\")\n4. UNIT CONVERSION: Convert one measurement to standard units (\"70 kg\" → \"154 lbs\")\n5. MEDICATION CONTEXT: Add indication to one medication (\"metformin\" → \"metformin for diabetes\")\n\n**CRITICAL:**\n- Apply ONLY to ONE location in the entire note\n- Keep everything else IDENTICAL (verify with ctrl+F)\n- Change must be medically safe and realistic\n\n**Note:**\n{note}\n\n**Output:** Only the modified note with EXACTLY ONE change.
