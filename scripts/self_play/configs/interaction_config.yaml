# MedSeRL Two-Turn Self-Play Interaction Configuration
# Following verl's Interaction System for Multi-turn RL Training
# See: https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sglang_multiturn/interaction_system.html
#
# Game Design (from SeRL paper arXiv:2506.07468):
# - Turn 1 (Injector): Model modifies clinical note (benign OR error injection)
# - Turn 2 (Assessor): Model classifies note as CORRECT or INCORRECT
# - Zero-sum rewards: If Assessor wins, Injector loses and vice versa
# - Hidden CoT: Injector's <think> and final_answer are stripped before Assessor sees note
