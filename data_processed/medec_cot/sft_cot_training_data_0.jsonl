Error Strategy Selection:\n   - Target error type: Wrong diagnosis.\n   - Why this error is \"sneaky\":\n     * Cognitive mechanism: Representativeness heuristic - provider sees \"unusual movements + cognitive decline\" and recalls Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n     * Plausibility factor: Both Huntington and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease share symptoms like cognitive decline and movement disorders.\n     * Detection difficulty: Requires careful consideration of family history and typical onset age, both of which are subtle clues.\n   - Expected difficulty level: Medium (misinterpretation of family history is possible under time constraints).\n   - Clinical risk level: Moderate to Severe (incorrect diagnosis would lead to inappropriate management and counseling).\n   - **Strategic choice**: Demonstrates the importance of integrating family history and symptom chronology in neurodegenerative diagnoses.\n\n3. Error Injection Mechanism:\n   - Original correct statement: \"Suspected of Huntington disease.\"\n   - Adversarial modification: \"Suspected of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\"\n   - Preservation of plausibility:\n     * Both diseases share psychiatric and neurological symptoms.\n     * The patient's presentation of cognitive and motor symptoms makes the error superficially credible.\n   - Critical clue planted: Father's suicide at age 50 suggests a hereditary condition, more indicative of Huntington disease.\n   - **Trap design**: Tests the model's ability to synthesize family history with clinical presentation to arrive at a correct diagnosis.\n\n4. Adversarial Reasoning (Why a clinician might make this mistake):\n   - Cognitive shortcuts:\n     * \"Movement disorder + dementia-like symptoms \u2192 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\" (misalignment with age and family history).\n   - Time pressure scenario: Busy clinic, provider focuses on prominent movement and cognitive symptoms without thorough review of family history.\n   - Knowledge gap: Lack of awareness about the significance of family history in diagnosing Huntington disease.\n   - Pattern mismatch: Overlooks typical age of onset and hereditary pattern associated with Huntington disease.\n   - **Teaching value**: Reinforces the need for comprehensive evaluation of family history and symptom evolution in neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n5.

Analysis of Correct Note:\n   - Clinical situation: A 64-year-old woman with symptoms suggestive of a nutritional deficiency or bone metabolism issue, presenting with muscle aches and decreased BMI.\n   - Current correct management: Diagnosis of osteomalacia based on lab findings and clinical presentation.\n   - Key patient factors:\n     * Age: 64 years old, post-menopausal, at risk for bone density issues.\n     * Recent weight loss and difficulty with self-care, suggestive of nutritional deficiencies.\n     * Low calcium (Ca2+) and phosphorus levels, high parathyroid hormone (PTH), indicative of osteomalacia.\n   - **Vulnerability points identified**:\n     * Similarity in presentation between osteomalacia and osteoporosis (both involve bone weakness).\n     * Common confusion between the two conditions due to overlap in demographic risk factors (age-related bone issues).\n     * High PTH level is a key differentiator but can be overlooked.\n\n2. Error Strategy Selection:\n   - Target error type: Wrong diagnosis.\n   - Why this error is \"sneaky\":\n     * Cognitive mechanism: Availability heuristic - osteoporosis is a more commonly discussed and recognized condition.\n     * Plausibility factor: The patient's age and symptoms fit the profile for osteoporosis, making it an easy cognitive leap.\n     * Detection difficulty: Requires careful analysis of lab values (calcium, phosphorus, PTH) to distinguish between osteomalacia and osteoporosis.\n   - Expected difficulty level: Medium (requires integration of lab data with clinical picture).\n   - Clinical risk level: Moderate (misdiagnosis could lead to inappropriate treatment, missing vitamin D supplementation).\n   - **Strategic choice**: Tests model's ability to differentiate between similar conditions and depend on lab findings rather than assumptions based on patient demographics alone.\n\n3. Error Injection Mechanism:\n   - Original correct statement: \"Patient is diagnosed with osteomalacia after lab work is drawn and is as follows:\"\n   - Adversarial modification: \"Patient is diagnosed with osteoporosis after lab work is drawn and is as follows:\"\n   - Preservation of plausibility:\n     * Maintained consistent symptoms (muscle aches, decreased BMI) \u2713\n     * Did not alter lab results, which remain consistent with osteomalacia \u2713\n     * Relied on common confusion between osteomalacia and osteoporosis \u2713\n   - Critical clue planted: The lab values indicating low calcium and phosphorus with high PTH, which are diagnostic for osteomalacia.\n   - **Trap design**: Tests if the model can accurately interpret lab data and differentiate between conditions that have superficially similar presentations.\n\n4. Adversarial Reasoning (Why a clinician might make this mistake):\n   - Cognitive shortcuts:\n     * \"Elderly woman with bone-related symptoms \u2192 osteoporosis\" (common assumption)\n     * \"Common condition = likely diagnosis\" (availability heuristic)\n   - Time pressure scenario: A busy clinic setting where lab results are quickly reviewed without thorough analysis.\n   - Knowledge gap: Specific understanding of the biochemical differences between osteomalacia and osteoporosis.\n   - Pattern mismatch: Misalignment between common age-related bone health issues and the specific lab indicators present.\n   - **Teaching value**: Reinforces the importance of accurate lab interpretation and understanding of bone metabolism disorders.\n\n5.

Analysis of Correct Note:\n   - Clinical situation: A 35-year-old pregnant woman presents with fever, headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, bleeding gums, and petechiae. She has recently returned from a trip to Sri Lanka. Lab findings suggest microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.\n   - Current correct management: Diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings (e.g., low platelets, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and negative Coomb's test).\n   - Key patient factors:\n     * Pregnancy: Increases risk for TTP due to hypercoagulable state\n     * Recent travel: Exposure to infectious agents or environmental toxins\n     * Lab findings: Low platelets, negative fibrin split products, and peripheral smear suggestive of schistocytes\n   - **Vulnerability points identified**:\n     * Similar symptom profile between TTP and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n     * Both conditions involve thrombocytopenia and bleeding\n     * Complex cases with overlapping features can lead to diagnostic confusion\n\n2. Error Strategy Selection:\n   - Target error type: Wrong diagnosis\n   - Why this error is \"sneaky\":\n     * Cognitive mechanism: Availability heuristic - clinician may recall DIC more readily due to familiarity or recent exposure to similar cases\n     * Plausibility factor: Both TTP and DIC involve thrombocytopenia and bleeding, making them easily confused\n     * Detection difficulty: Requires careful analysis of lab findings that differentiate TTP from DIC (e.g., fibrin split products, Coomb's test)\n   - Expected difficulty level: Medium (differentiating TTP from DIC is subtle and requires attention to specific lab details)\n   - Clinical risk level: Severe (misdiagnosis could lead to inappropriate treatment and maternal or fetal harm)\n   - **Strategic choice**: Teaches the model to differentiate between similar hematologic conditions with distinct management strategies\n\n3. Error Injection Mechanism:\n   - Original correct statement: \"Based on the following findings, patient was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.\"\n   - Adversarial modification: \"Based on the following findings, patient was diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation.\"\n   - Preservation of plausibility:\n     * Maintained the context of thrombocytopenia and bleeding\n     * Did not alter other data points that could overtly suggest DIC (e.g., INR, fibrin split products)\n   - Critical clue planted: Negative fibrin split products and normal INR are inconsistent with DIC\n   - **Trap design**: Tests clinician's ability to integrate and interpret lab data in context of clinical presentation\n\n4. Adversarial Reasoning (Why a clinician might make this mistake):\n   - Cognitive shortcuts:\n     * \"Thrombocytopenia + bleeding \u2192 could be DIC\" (correct as an initial thought)\n     * \"DIC is common in pregnancy-related complications\" (correct but not specific here)\n     * \"Therefore, diagnosis is DIC\" (WRONG - overlooks specific lab findings)\n   - Time pressure scenario: In a busy clinical environment, there's a risk of quickly categorizing the case based on surface-level similarities\n   - Knowledge gap: Requires understanding of specific lab tests that differentiate TTP from DIC\n   - Pattern mismatch: DIC typically involves prolonged INR and positive fibrin split products, which are absent here\n   - **Teaching value**: Reinforces the importance of distinguishing between similar hematologic disorders using specific laboratory criteria\n\n5.

Lab results show hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, indicative of an aldosteronoma.\n   - Current correct management: Diagnosis of aldosteronoma, consistent with symptoms and laboratory findings.\n   - Key patient factors:\n     * Symptoms: Fatigue, muscle weakness, recurrent headaches, palpitations.\n     * Medical history: Hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis.\n     * Social history: Smoker, occasional alcohol use.\n   - **Vulnerability points identified**:\n     * Overlapping symptoms with other endocrine disorders.\n     * Complexity in distinguishing between aldosteronoma and pheochromocytoma due to shared symptoms like hypertension and palpitations.\n\n2. Error Strategy Selection:\n   - Target error type: Wrong diagnosis.\n   - Why this error is \"sneaky\":\n     * Cognitive mechanism: Availability heuristic - provider might confuse similar endocrine disorders due to overlapping symptoms.\n     * Plausibility factor: Both aldosteronoma and pheochromocytoma can present with hypertension and palpitations.\n     * Detection difficulty: Requires careful analysis of lab results and understanding of endocrine pathophysiology to differentiate.\n   - Expected difficulty level: Medium (requires integration of lab findings with clinical symptoms).\n   - Clinical risk level: Moderate to severe if undetected, as treatment for pheochromocytoma could lead to inappropriate management.\n   - **Strategic choice**: Tests the model's ability to distinguish between similar endocrine disorders based on subtle laboratory differences.\n\n3. Error Injection Mechanism:\n   - Original correct statement: \"Patient was diagnosed with an aldosteronoma.\"\n   - Adversarial modification: \"Patient was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma.\"\n   - Preservation of plausibility:\n     * Symptoms of hypertension and palpitations fit both diagnoses \u2713\n     * Age and demographic are consistent with both conditions \u2713\n     * No changes to the rest of the clinical presentation that might give away the error easily \u2713\n   - Critical clue planted: Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in lab results are more indicative of aldosteronoma.\n   - **Trap design**: Tests the reader's ability to correlate lab findings (especially K+ and HCO3-) with the correct endocrine disorder.\n\n4. Adversarial Reasoning (Why a clinician might make this mistake):\n   - Cognitive shortcuts:\n     * \"Hypertension + palpitations \u2192 think pheochromocytoma\" (common association)\n     * Overlooking specific lab findings that point to aldosteronoma (hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis)\n   - Time pressure scenario: Busy clinic, quick decision-making leads to reliance on symptom overlap rather than detailed lab analysis.\n   - Knowledge gap: Lack of in-depth understanding of biochemical profiles associated with different adrenal disorders.\n   - Pattern mismatch: Misidentification of symptom cluster due to shared features with pheochromocytoma.\n   - **Teaching value**: Emphasizes the importance of correlating lab results with clinical symptoms in endocrine disorders.\n\n5.

Analysis of Correct Note:\n   - Clinical situation: Young male presenting with acute shoulder injury following a sports-related incident.\n   - Current correct management: Focus on neurological examination (test sensation of the lateral shoulder) to assess for potential axillary nerve injury, which is common in shoulder dislocations.\n   - Key patient factors:\n     * Young, active male with sports injury context.\n     * Presentation suggests anterior shoulder dislocation (externally rotated, slightly abducted position, empty glenoid fossa).\n     * No immediate distress, stable vital signs, and intact bilateral radial pulses.\n   - **Vulnerability points identified**:\n     * Common shoulder injury presentations often lead to premature procedural interventions.\n     * Neurological assessment can be easily overlooked if the focus is too quickly shifted to mechanical treatment.\n\n2. Error Strategy Selection:\n   - Target error type: Premature procedural intervention (management error)\n   - Why this error is \"sneaky\":\n     * Cognitive mechanism: Pattern recognition - assuming diagnosis equals immediate treatment.\n     * Plausibility factor: Closed reduction is a logical next step after confirming dislocation.\n     * Detection difficulty: Requires knowledge of the need for neurological evaluation prior to intervention.\n   - Expected difficulty level: Medium (requires awareness of full diagnostic protocol for shoulder dislocation)\n   - Clinical risk level: Moderate (risk of missing nerve injury, leading to long-term dysfunction)\n   - **Strategic choice**: Highlights importance of thorough diagnostic workup before proceeding to treatment, testing the model's understanding of protocol-driven care.\n\n3. Error Injection Mechanism:\n   - Original correct statement: \"Patient was scheduled for a test sensation of the lateral shoulder based on exam findings.\"\n   - Adversarial modification: \"Patient was scheduled for a closed reduction of the right shoulder based on exam findings.\"\n   - Preservation of plausibility:\n     * Maintained context of shoulder dislocation \u2713\n     * Used common medical terminology (closed reduction) \u2713\n     * Did not alter initial assessment findings \u2713\n   - Critical clue planted: Examination findings clearly indicate the need for neurological assessment (empty glenoid fossa, humeral head displacement).\n   - **Trap design**: Tests whether the model prioritizes complete assessment over immediate intervention, assessing knowledge of shoulder dislocation management.\n\n4. Adversarial Reasoning (Why a clinician might make this mistake):\n   - Cognitive shortcuts:\n     * \"Acute dislocation \u2192 reduce it\" (correct but premature without neuro check)\n     * \"Closed reduction = definitive treatment\" (correct but not first priority)\n   - Time pressure scenario: In a busy emergency setting, the provider might rush to treat the mechanical issue without completing the neurological exam.\n   - Knowledge gap: Lack of awareness of the protocol requiring sensation testing to rule out nerve injury before reduction.\n   - Pattern mismatch: Treatment before confirming absence of nerve damage deviates from standard protocol.\n   - **Teaching value**: Reinforces the importance of complete diagnostic approaches, ensuring all critical assessments are performed before intervention.\n\n5.

Note Construction Plan:\n   - Structure: Use a clear narrative format with relevant clinical details and management plan\n   - Key elements to include:\n     * Patient identifiers and context (age, gestational age)\n     * Detailed clinical findings (murmur, feeding issues)\n     * Diagnostic reasoning (why PDA is likely)\n     * Specific treatment plan (indomethacin infusion)\n     * Monitoring instructions (follow-up on potential side effects)\n   - Language: Professional, precise, complete\n\n5. Final Note Composition:\n   \"A 1-month-old infant is brought to the physician for a well-child examination.

Analysis of Correct Note:\n   - Clinical situation: 1-month-old premature infant with symptoms suggestive of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and a continuous murmur.\n   - Current correct management: Indomethacin infusion to pharmacologically close the PDA, which is standard first-line treatment in preterm infants.\n   - Key patient factors:\n     * Age: 1 month old\n     * Premature birth at 36 weeks' gestation\n     * Symptoms: Sweating during feeds, tachycardia, continuous murmur\n   - **Vulnerability points identified**:\n     * Preterm infants with PDA often present with similar symptoms, but management can vary.\n     * Continuous murmur and feeding difficulties may lead to considerations of surgical intervention if medication fails.\n\n2. Error Strategy Selection:\n   - Target error type: Management error (choice of intervention)\n   - Why this error is \"sneaky\":\n     * Cognitive mechanism: Premature infants with significant PDAs may eventually require surgical intervention if medical management fails, making surgery a recognizable option.\n     * Plausibility factor: Percutaneous PDA closure is a legitimate treatment for PDAs, especially if medical management is not effective.\n     * Detection difficulty: Requires awareness of guidelines that prioritize medical management first in this demographic.\n   - Expected difficulty level: Medium (requires understanding of treatment hierarchy for PDA in preterm infants)\n   - Clinical risk level: Moderate (unnecessary surgical intervention in a case potentially manageable with medication)\n   - **Strategic choice**: Highlights the importance of adhering to guidelines for pharmacological treatment before considering invasive options in preterm infants.\n\n3. Error Injection Mechanism:\n   - Original correct statement: \"Patient is started on indomethacin infusion after confirming the diagnosis via echocardiography.\"\n   - Adversarial modification: \"Patient is scheduled for percutaneous surgery after confirming the diagnosis via echocardiography.\"\n   - Preservation of plausibility:\n     * Diagnosis of PDA confirmed via echocardiography, consistent with either treatment option \u2713\n     * Maintained logical progression from diagnosis to treatment \u2713\n     * Did not alter other clinical findings that could contradict surgical decision \u2713\n   - Critical clue planted: Infant's age and premature status suggest medical management first.\n   - **Trap design**: Tests the model's ability to recognize the standard treatment protocol and prioritize non-invasive options initially.\n\n4. Adversarial Reasoning (Why a clinician might make this mistake):\n   - Cognitive shortcuts:\n     * \"PDA needs closure\" (correct)\n     * \"Surgical options available\" (correct)\n     * \"Therefore, schedule surgery\" (WRONG - skips first-line medical management)\n   - Time pressure scenario: In a setting with multiple cases to handle, a provider might quickly decide on a definitive solution if unaware of the typical stepwise approach.\n   - Knowledge gap: Lack of detailed knowledge regarding the indications for pharmacological vs. surgical treatment in preterm infants with PDA.\n   - Pattern mismatch: Surgery is indeed an option, but not the immediate first-line choice for this specific patient group.\n   - **Teaching value**: Reinforces the importance of following treatment protocols and understanding the rationale behind first-line pharmacological interventions.\n\n5.
